Project Title: CrashDataApp

    Project Description:

        CrashDataApp is a Shiny Web Application used for the visualization of Traffic Accident Fatality Data from 2021.
        It is structured with 4 tabs, two of which demonstrate different methods to geographically visualize the data,
        either nationally or by state. The other two tabs show general information of trends and accident counts by 
        state. Interactivity with each graphic was a large focus of this project.
    
        Along with the code for the app, this repository includes the data used (.csv and .shp files) and the R script
        used for data pipelining/manipulation. Though the R script does not currently have comments, it mostly uses,
        dplyr, so it shouldn't be terribly hard to interpret at this time.
        
        This application was made using RStudio.
